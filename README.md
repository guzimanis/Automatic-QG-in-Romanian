# Automatic Question Generation in Romanian
This is the thesis for the Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of TÃ¼bingen under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Detmar Meurers

## Abstract
This thesis shows the first approach towards an automatic question generation system for the Romanian language. The goal of the project is to be able to generate questions for the subject, object and root of a sentence automatically, based on the part-of-speech tags of the sentence and constructs the question following different generated templates, which are based on the syntax of a correct question in Romanian. The performance of the system is tested on four different Romanian texts with various language difficulties. In general, the system performed well for the fact that it is the first approach for this language.
